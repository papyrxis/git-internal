# git-internal

A practical exploration of Git's internals from an engineering perspective.  
This repository accompanies the PDF: [main.pdf](https://github.com/papyrxis/git-internal/blob/main/main.pdf).

It’s not a Git tutorial—it's about understanding how Git works, its architecture, data model, and design decisions.
